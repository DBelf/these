[Everyday, millions of Internet users access AJAX-powered web applications. However, such richness is prone to security issues. In particular, Web 2.0 attacks are difficult to detect and block since it is similar to legitimate traffic. As a ground for our research, we review past related works and explain what might be missing to tackle Web 2.0 security issues. Especially, we show that tackling AJAX-based attacks often lacks a context that can only be conveyed during real-time analysis. In our research, we advocate the usage of abstract interpretation of JavaScript code to provide maximum coverage and to ensure completeness. Besides, we introduce a proxy-based proposal to provide analysis of JavaScript malware.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220785995_Towards_revealing_JavaScript_program_intents_using_abstract_interpretation "Revamping JavaScript static analysis via localization and remediation of root causes of imprecision")
