[Everyday, millions of Internet users access AJAX-powered web applications. However, such richness is prone to security issues. In particular, Web 2.0 attacks are difficult to detect and block since it is similar to legitimate traffic. As a ground for our research, we review past related works and explain what might be missing to tackle Web 2.0 security issues. Especially, we show that tackling AJAX-based attacks often lacks a context that can only be conveyed during real-time analysis. In our research, we advocate the usage of abstract interpretation of JavaScript code to provide maximum coverage and to ensure completeness. Besides, we introduce a proxy-based proposal to provide analysis of JavaScript malware.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220785995_Towards_revealing_JavaScript_program_intents_using_abstract_interpretation "Revamping JavaScript static analysis via localization and remediation of root causes of imprecision") 


[Vulnerable web browser extensions can be used by an attacker to steal users' credentials and lure users into leaking sensitive information to unauthorized parties. Current browser security models and existing JavaScript security solutions are inadequate for preventing JavaScript injection attacks that can exploit such vulnerable extensions. In this paper, we present a runtime protection mechanism based on a code randomization technique coupled with a static analysis technique to protect browser extensions from JavaScript injection attacks. The protection is enforced at runtime by distinguishing malicious code from the randomized extension code. We implemented our protection mechanism for the Mozilla Firefox browser and evaluated it on a set of vulnerable and non-vulnerable Firefox extensions. The evaluation results indicate that our approach can be a viable solution for preventing attacks on JavaScript-based browser extensions. In designing and implementing our approach, we were also able to reduce false positives and achieve maximum backward compatibility with existing extensions.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6601823/ "Protecting Web Browser Extensions from JavaScript Injection Attacks")
